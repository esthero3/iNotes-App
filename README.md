1. From working on this app, I learned more about databases and working with Xcode in general. I learnt how to 
add constraints to the storyboard and how to really work with arrays. The basic version of the app where the
notes saved to the phone went well for me, I was ahead of time and I found it quite easy. I also learned about
NSUserDefaults from doing that version.

2. One of the earliest problems I had was connecting the Table View Controller to the respective storyboard. There was a typo
in the name and it took me a whole class to find the error. Another big problem I had was after I was able to get the notes
to save to firebase, retriving the notes took a loongg time because of the format of my code and the type I was trying to
make the notes show up in. I kept getting a cannot convert type [String : String] to type String. And after I was finally able
to make the error go away, the notes would not show up on the app. I was finally able to figure out a proper way to retrieve
the notes. Trying to solve this particular error really slowed me down because it took about 5 classes to finally figure it 
out.

3. If I were to start over today, I would definately add more function to my app. I would add a way to delete notes, I could
not add this because I ran out of time to figure out how to make the notes delete not just from the phone but from the 
database as well. I would also make my app look much nicer and add a way for notes to be shared between users of the app.
